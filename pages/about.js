              <p>Acorn to Oak is a Sacramento-based nursery and preschool designed for children ages 3 months to 5 years. Our philosophy draws inspiration from the beauty and nature of Waldorf, the emergent curriculum of Reggio Emilia, and the child-focused learning of Montessori.</p>

                <h2>Directors</h2>
                <p>Francesca and Isobel are sisters who grew up in the Sacramento area and have always had a special place in their hearts for the community. Both Isobel and Francesca share a passion for early childhood education and are fully qualified as infant and preschool teachers as well as directors. They are also working towards a masters degree in Human Development with an emphasis on Early Childhood Education to add to their multiple other degrees.</p>
                <p>Growing up, they watched their mother and her business partner run multiple child care centers across Northern California, providing them with the opportunity to experience high-quality child care first-hand. As Sacramento experiences a severe shortage of high-quality child care, Francesca and Isobel are excited to use their experience to create a new space for the children of this community, including their own.</p>
